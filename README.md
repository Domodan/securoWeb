# MCN 7205: Secure Software Architecture and Design - Assignment

## Project Title: Developing a Secure Web Application

---

## Objectives
This project will provide the graduate class with hands-on experience in secure software architecture, design, and development. You will develop skills in certain coding practices, security testing, and optimization. By the end of the project, your team will have a well-architected and secure web application that can be further extended and developed.

---

## Requirements
This project will be done in one group as a class. Please choose your role in the team after understanding the specification. This role must be an active role with clear contributions that you will present in week 4.

Your team MUST create a git repository named ```securoWeb ``` where you will invite me as a contributor using ```kougaus@gmail.com ```


---

## Description
In this project, as graduate students, you will work on developing a secure web application that implements best practices for secure software architecture. The web application will be developed using a popular web development framework such as ```Django ```, ```Flask ```, ```Laravel ``` or ```Node.js ```. The project will involve exploring various techniques and tools for secure software architecture and design, such as secure coding practices, input/output filtering, access controls, encryption, and authentication/authorization.

# Project Structure

## Week 1: Project Planning and Research [21st March 2023]
During the first week, you will describe the use case for the web application, define the functional and non-functional scope of the project, and, research secure software architecture techniques and best practices. You will select a web development framework and create a project plan, including the project timeline, milestones, and deliverables. ```[Documented all your plan] ```

## Week 2: Application Design and Development [28th March 2023]
During the second week, you will design the application's architecture, including the database schema, API endpoints, and user interface. You will implement secure coding practices such as input/output filtering, exception handling, and error logging. The team must also explore various authentication and authorization methods to secure the application. ```[Documented all your design] ```

## Week 3: Security Testing and Optimization [4th April 2023]
During the third week, your team will test the application for security vulnerabilities such as ```SQL injection ```, ```cross-site scripting ```, and ```cross-site request forgery ```. The team will set up and use popular security testing tools such as ```OWASP ZAP ``` and ```Burp Suite ```. Your team will optimize the application's performance, including database queries, API endpoints, and frontend code. ```[Document the testing and optimization techniques and procedure] ```

## Week 4: Finalization and Presentation [11th April 2023]
During this fourth week, your team will finalize the application and prepare a presentation to showcase the project. The presentation will include an overview of the secure software architecture techniques and tools used in the project, the challenges encountered, and the lessons learned. In a summary report, there must be a table where each team member must clearly indicate their specific contribution to this project.
